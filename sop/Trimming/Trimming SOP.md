## Section 3 — Creating Trimmed Flower Containers

### 1. Purpose

### 2. Procedure

#### 3.1 Prepare Trimmed Flower Bucket

1. Line a clean container with a breathable liner.
2. Affix one unused **3 × 4 inch Metrc Package Tag UID (Processing License)** to the container lid.

#### 3.2 Transfer Flower From Bucked Tote to Trimmed Bucket (Metrc)

1. Log into Metrc under the **Processing license**.
2. Navigate to: **Processing → Packages → Create Package**.
3. For the trimmed flower bucket:
    - **Source Package:** Select the bucked flower tote UID.

    - **Quantity:** Enter the trimmed flower weight being added.
    - **Count:** `1`.
    - **Package Tag UID:** Enter the UID affixed to the trimmed flower bucket.

**Important Rule**

- A trimmed flower bucket may receive material from **only one bucked tote UID**.
- If a bucked tote is finished and the trimmed bucket is not full, **do not add flower from a different tote.**
- Close the bucket, create the Metrc package, and start a new trimmed flower bucket with a new UID for the next tote.
