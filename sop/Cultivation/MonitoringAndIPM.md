### 6. Definitions
- **IPM:** Integrated Pest Management – a systematic approach using prevention, monitoring, and targeted treatment.
- **Scouting:** Visual inspection of plants to detect pests or disease.
- **Sticky Trap:** Adhesive card used to capture flying insects for monitoring.

---

### 7. Monitoring Procedure

#### 7.1 Sticky Trap Placement
1. Place traps at canopy height in each room:
   - Minimum of **1 trap per 100–200 sq ft**.
2. Label each trap with:
   - Room
   - Date placed
   - Initials
3. Replace traps **weekly** or sooner if saturated.

---

#### 7.2 Visual Scouting (Minimum 2× Weekly)
1. Inspect underside of leaves, petioles, stems, and growing tips.
2. Look for:
   - **Insects:** thrips, aphids, fungus gnats, mites, whiteflies
   - **Damage:** stippling, leaf curl, necrotic spots, webbing
   - **Disease:** powdery mildew, botrytis, leaf spot, wilting
3. Use hand lens to confirm species when needed.
4. Record findings in IPM log.

---

### 8. Action Thresholds
| Pest/Disease | Trigger for Action |
|---------------|------------------|
| Fungus gnats  | ≥5 per trap per week |
| Thrips        | ≥2 adults per trap or visible larvae |
| Aphids        | Any live colony |
| Spider mites  | Any confirmed presence |
| Powdery mildew| Any visible spores |
| Botrytis      | Any infected tissue |
