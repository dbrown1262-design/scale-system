### Operating the Weighing Application

1. Select **"Weigh Plants"** from the Harvest menu.
2. Confirm **Plant Type = "Wet."**
3. Since each plant has a unique ID, no crop or strain selection is required.

**Hang the plant:**

1. Place an S-hook on a lower branch.
2. Hang the plant upside down from the scale.
   - This same hook will be used to hang the plant in the drying room after weighing.
3. Verify the weight appears in the **Weight** box on screen.
4. Use the handheld QR reader to scan the plant tag.

The system will:

- Record the weight
- Add a line to the Log box
- Associate the weight with the correct Plant ID automatically.

### If a QR Code Does Not Scan

1. Hang the plant on the scale and verify the weight is displayed.
2. Type the Plant ID manually.
3. Click **Process Current Plant**.

### Duplicate Weighing Warning

If the plant has already been weighed:

- The system will display a warning message with options:
  - Cancel
  - Replace the Existing Weight

> This commonly occurs when weighing dry plants while the application is still set to **Wet** mode.

### After Weighing

1. Hang the plant in the drying room.
2. Ensure the plant tag remains attached so it can be identified and weighed again after drying.
