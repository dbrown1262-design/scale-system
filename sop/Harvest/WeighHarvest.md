## 4. Operating the Weighing Application

1. Open the Harvest menu.

3. If there is a red message in the upper right that says **Scale Not Found**:
   - Make sure the Ranger scale is turned on.  
   - Check the USB cable connection.  
4. The scanner should beep when the app starts:
   - If the scanner is not on, the app will prompt you to turn it on and retry.  
   - Press the trigger on the scanner.  
   - Click **Retry**.  
5. Select the correct **Plant Type**:
   - **Wet** — freshly harvested plants.  
   - **Dry** — plants removed from drying racks.  
6. No crop or strain selection is required — each plant uses its unique Plant ID.

## 5. Weighing a Plant

### 5.1 Wet Plants

1. Attach a clean "S" hook to a lower branch of the plant.  
2. Hang the plant upside down from the scale.
   - This same hook will be used to hang the plant in the drying room after weighing.  
3. Verify the weight appears in the **Weight** field on screen.  
4. Scan the plant tag using the handheld QR scanner.

---

### 5.2 Dry Plants

1. The plant will already have an "S" hook attached.  
2. Hang the plant by the existing hook onto the scale.  
3. Verify the weight appears in the **Weight** field on screen.  
4. Scan the plant tag using the handheld QR scanner.  
5. After processing, remove the "S" hook and place it into the **plastic tote**.

---

When scanned, the system will automatically:

- Record the plant weight.  
- Add an entry to the Log box.  
- Associate the weight with the correct Plant ID.

---

## 6. If a QR Code Does Not Scan

1. Hang the plant and confirm the weight is displayed.  
2. Manually type the Plant ID into the application.  
3. Click **Process Current Plant**.

---

## 7. Duplicate Weighing Warning

If a plant has already been weighed, the system will display a warning with options:

- **Cancel**  
- **Replace Existing Weight**

> **Warning:** This commonly occurs when the incorrect **Plant Type (Wet or Dry)** is selected.  
> Always verify the Plant Type before continuing.
