#### 5.1 Prepare the Tote

1. Line a 27-gallon tote with a breathable tote liner.
2. Fill the liner with bucked flower from a single strain.
3. Seal the liner with a zip tie.
4. Attach a Metric tag to the sealed liner.

#### 5.2 Weigh the Tote

1. Remove the sealed liner from the tote.
2. Hang the liner bag from the scale using the "S" hook.
3. Verify the weight appears in the **Tote Weight (g)** field on screen.
4. Scan the Metric tag using the handheld QR scanner.

### 6. Save Tote Weight

1. After the weight stabilizes and the Metric tag is entered, click **Save Tote Weight**.
2. The system will:
	- Validate the Metric tag exists in the database
	- Check if the tag has already been weighed
	- Save the weight and associate it with the Crop, Strain, and Metric tag
	- Automatically print a label for the tote
3. The Metric Tag field will clear, ready for the next bag.

### 8. Duplicate Weighing Warning

If a Metric tag has already been weighed, the system will display a warning:

> **Tag Already Weighed**
> Metric tag [number] has weight [value] g. Replace this weight?

Options:
- **Yes** — Replace the existing weight with the current weight
- **No** — Cancel the update and keep the original weight

> **Note:** Use caution when replacing weights. Verify the Metric tag number is correct before proceeding.

### 9. Print Label (Reprint)

If you need to reprint a label for a previously weighed tote:

1. Select the **Crop** and **Strain**.
2. Enter or scan the **Metric Tag** number.

### 12. Troubleshooting

**QR Scanner not working:**
- Verify scanner status shows "QR: Connected"
- Turn scanner on and press trigger
- Manually enter Metric tag number if scanner fails

**Scale not reading:**
- Verify scale status shows "Scale: Connected"
- Check scale power and USB connection
- Ensure scale is tared to zero
- Check that the "S" hook is properly attached

**Invalid Tag error:**
- Verify the Metric tag number is correct
- Ensure the tag exists in the Metric tag database
- Contact administrator if tag should be valid but is rejected

**Weight appears incorrect:**
- Ensure tare weight is zero before hanging bag
- Check that only the liner bag is hanging (not touching tote)
- Verify scale is stable and not swinging
- Allow weight to stabilize before saving
